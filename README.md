# real-time-electricity-demand-forecasting
This project demonstrates how to build a real-time electricity demand forecasting dashboard using FastAPI, WebSocket, and Plotly. It simulates live electricity usage data and streams it to a web-based dashboard for monitoring and analysis—ideal for smart grid solutions and urban energy management.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
FastAPI – for building the REST API
Uvicorn – ASGI server for FastAPI
WebSockets – for real-time data transfer
ngrok – to expose your local app to the internet
Nest-Asyncio – to handle async inside Jupyter/Colab
Pandas, Numpy – for data handling
Plotly – for interactive visualizations
Google Colab – to run everything in the cloud
